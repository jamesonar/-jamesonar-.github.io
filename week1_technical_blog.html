I'll discuss two of my three websites together because I like them for the same reason. This websites
are Apple.com and Uber.com. If design thinking places and emphasis on empathy, creativity, and rationality,
these two sites put the focus on empathy. The first thing that you'll likely notice on both of these
sites is that they feature very prominent images on the top of their page.</p>

<image src="http://i.imgur.com/03WTeBG.png" height="300" alt="Apple Wireframe"></image>
<image src="http://i.imgur.com/L9ARSFR.png" height="300" alt="Uber Wireframe 1"></image>

<p>The images practically take up the whole screen. I imagine the purpose of this is create an impression on the user before
they do anything else. Apple's images generally features close up, high resolution photos of their products. This 
gives a strong impression regarding the quality of their product's design. In turn, Uber's site features
a series of equally large photos of attractive, fashionable people on the move. This is Uber's attempt
to define their service not by the cars themselfs, but by the people who use it.</p>

<p>The balance that both sites need to manage is the tradetrade-off between focusing on the impression 
versus the "rational" component of the site (i.e. getting the customer to do what you want them
to). The sites take different approaches to this. Uber prominently displays a small sign up button in
middle of their landing page while Apple, rightly assuming that prospective buyers of their products
will need more information before they buy anything, requires that customers navigate through less
conspicuous buttons along the top
</p>

The New York Times website is compeltely different from the first two, which is driven by function.
The websites of Apple and Uber are designed as tools to market a product. The New York Times's site
to a large extent is its product, and it's product is content. As a result, the website attemtps to 
display as much content as possible without feeling cluttered. Here rationality takes presedence over
empathy.
